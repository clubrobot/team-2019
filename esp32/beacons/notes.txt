Ranging tests :

"To get absolute and correct distance measurements the module needs to be calibrated/biased (e.g. choosing values for the antenna delay) - but this should be easy then and stable ranging results are definitely more important, I think. (... the API for calibration will be available soon)"

=> where is the corresponding API for antena calibration??? No API available

" are the antennas (these ceramic antennas from the DWM1000) pointing upwards and not lying flat on a table?
When the signal propagation is disrupted heavily you will get these deviations."

" I found that the DW1000Ranging example gives slightly better ranging performance than the regular ranging example, but still shows increasing ranging bias with measurement distance (just a little less). This is likely caused by the fact that the DW1000Ranging example operates on the 64 MHz PRF mode with long preamble."


" I changed the timestamp correction in the correctTimestamp function from timestamp += adjustmentTime to timestamp -= adjustmentTime." (see here : https://github.com/thotro/arduino-dw1000/issues/143)
